**Podcasts:**  
I really love podcasts, I always listen to them when I'm driving. This session was perfect because I had to drive to rowing practice in Springfield and I was able to relax and listen to these two podcasts. I listened to the EdTech bites podcast first, the title that sparked my interest was EdTech in Athletics. I was very curious about how coaches were trying to implement athletics in their schools. The episode featured Eddie Moreno, a math teacher and athletic coordinator, who talked about how he used flipgrid to get students back into athletic mode. Eddie would take a video of a workout plan he created and upload them to flipgrid. Then, students uploaded videos of their workouts so that Eddie could critique and evaluate their form and efficiency. It was really interesting because they talked about how this strategy benefited not only the students but the teachers and parents as well. The flipgrid videos give students more structure, which benefits the parent, and gets them engaged in athletics, which is a big interest to students. Coaches can provide effective feedback and create more engaging communication between teachers and students.

The second podcast I listened to was the House of Edtech. I listened to their most recent podcast and the host primarily talked about self-care and tech breaks. I really enjoyed his segments on self-care because he explained that self-care techniques differ for everyone. I would often look up self-care techniques and I never was interested in the ones they would recommend. He also mentioned how positivity doesn't mean ignorance on what's happening; and I really appreciate those words. The host mentioned the benefits of digital detoxes, then recommended the 20-20-20 rule to help limit eye strain. The rule states every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, you should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Overall, I really enjoyed this podcasts and definitely benefited from them
